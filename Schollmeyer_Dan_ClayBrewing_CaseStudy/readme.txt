[] As a supply manager I would like to be able to increase inventory so that our inventory is up-to-date.
[] As a brewer I would like to be able to review inventory so that I know which beer we have supplies on hand for.
[] As a supply manager I would like to review inventory so that I know when to re-order supplies.
